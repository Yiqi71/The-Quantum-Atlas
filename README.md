The Quantum Atlas

An interactive, visual-first walkthrough of quantum computing workflows built during the Quantum Creators Con Hackathon (Spring 2025) to make complex concepts accessible to non-expert audiences.

Role
- Mechanics design (interaction logic and game-like flow)
- Front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Team + Collaboration
- Collaborated with engineering teammates to learn core technical principles under time pressure
- Worked with illustrators to shape narrative and visual structure
- Integrated technical logic and visual storytelling into a single interactive prototype

Highlights
- Translated abstract quantum concepts into interactive, step-by-step visual experiences
- Balanced technical accuracy with cognitive accessibility for non-experts
- Structured unfamiliar information so users can reason with it, not just consume it

Process Snapshot
- Learned core quantum logic from engineering teammates
- Defined interaction mechanics and narrative flow with illustrators
- Built the front-end prototype and iterated rapidly during the hackathon

Tech + Tools
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (custom interactions and animations)

Demo
- Add demo link / video here

How to Run
- Open `index.html` in a browser

Learnings
- Treating disciplinary gaps as constraints sharpened collaboration and decision-making
- Time-boxed collaboration improved clarity of ownership and faster integration
